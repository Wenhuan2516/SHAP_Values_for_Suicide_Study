# SHAP_Values_for_Suicide_Study
### SHAP Value Methods was applied to check the associations between suicide rates and rurality, altitude, climate factors, and social economic factors from 2010 to 2020. Suicide rates are divided to 3 groups: suicide by all means, suicides by firearms, suicides by non-firearms. SHAP values are investigated in each single year and multiple 5-year periods such as 2010 to 2014, 2011 to 2015 ans so on.
### Here I am using SHAP Values in year 2016 as an example to show you how I built the model and get the results.
